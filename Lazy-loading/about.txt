What is React.suspense?

React.Suspense is a component in React that allows you to suspend rendering of a component until a certain condition is met. This is particularly useful for implementing lazy loading of components, where you want to load a component only when it is actually needed, rather than loading all components at once.

const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent'));

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <SomeComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
